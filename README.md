# A Project to Learn Rust
- Follow along: [build a webserver in rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html)

## Setup
1. install rust and cargo (see: [Rustbook install](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-01-installation.html))
2. Clone this project
3. Cargo run!
4. Visit `127.0.0.1:7878` to see a hello message immediately
5. Try `127.0.0.1:7878/sleep` to checkout what happens when you tell each thread to sleep 5 seconds
6. Checkout the console to see all the Workers getting jobs!

### Messy Git history
I loosely documented thoughts throughout my git history. IT is most probably not incredibly useful but I use it as something to go back to when I'm looking at why some choices were made.
